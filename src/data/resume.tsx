        ðŸ‘‰ I developed an application for tracking the authenticity of payment receipts in the educational environment, focusing on fraud prevention. This reduced the occurrence of counterfeit receipts by up to 80%, increasing security and trust in the financial process.

ðŸ‘‰ I was responsible for automating the institution's bell system, enabling the administrative team to schedule activation times and use a radio channel to broadcast information to students. This automation improved internal communication and management efficiency by 75%.

ðŸ‘‰ I contributed to the development of a video streaming platform for the institution, allowing parents to remotely follow internal school activities while also providing access to a gallery of photos taken during events.

ðŸ‘‰ I developed interfaces with a strong focus on the pixel-perfect concept, ensuring high performance and accessibility for end users.

ðŸ‘‰ I created an AI-powered system for sentiment analysis and evaluation of student feedback collected during assessments. The AI provided the institution with detailed reports based on student responses, generating insights into their challenges and limitations.

ðŸ‘‰ I participated in the development of the "Client Dashboard" for a test paper management and distribution machine, allowing users to manage their accounts, access test papers and report cards, and request wallet top-ups. This interactive system increased the efficiency of the test paper distribution process by up to 52%.
